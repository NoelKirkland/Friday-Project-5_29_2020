    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am just your normal 27 your old guy. I was born and raised in Portland Oregon, and went to highschool at Grover Cleveland High. Right after highschool I packed up and moved to Chicago Illinois for a year. I never planned on living there for good, I guess I just wanted to experience independence after living with my family my whole life. After Chicago I moved back to Portland where I rented my own apartment, worked as a line cook, and dabbled in community college a little bit. When I was 23 years old I started feeling a little restless again living in Portland and wanted to leave. I thought to myself "which city will have the best weather in all of America?" and I quickly concluded that I would move to San Diego California.</p>
    <p>In California I finally landed my first real career job working at a tech strart-up. This is where I was first introduced to coding which piqued my interest immediately, but I didn't really do much with. After a couple of years spent down in San Diego I moved back up to Portland where I landed another job at another tech. Again, people were coding there, and it really intrigued me, but I just didn't have the know-how to do much myself</p>
    <h2>My Hobbies & Interests</h2>
    <p>I have many hobbies and interests, but here are a few of my favorites</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Playing classical guitar, primarily Spanish and flamenco styles</li>
      <li>Meditation and Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (or MBSR for short)</li>
      <li>Everything outdoors! Hiking, biking and backpacking</li>
      <li>Exercise and nutrition</li>
      <li>Teaching myself different computer coding languages</li>
      <li>Playing with my dog, Ruby!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>My Dog Ruby</h2>
    <p>Ruby is a purebred Brittany Spaniel. She is 4 years old. And she is the cutest, goodest bog in the world.</p>
    <h2>Ruby's Interests</h2>
    <p>here is a list of some of Ruby's most favorite activities</p>
    <ul>
      <li>playing tug-of-war</li>
      <li>barking at nothing</li>
      <li>being the worlds most cute dog</li>
      <li>playing with toys</li>
      <li>last but not least, Ruby's <b>favorite</b> thing. Chasing squirrels!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ruby loves playing with most toys but, she likes playing with some more than others. Here is a list of her toys from least favorite to most favorite</p>
    <ol reversed>
      <li>gross old tennis ball</li>
      <li>frisbee</li>
      <li>stolen socks</li>
      <li>but most of all she loves her giraffe toy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>My Background</h2>
    <div class="column">
      <p>I graduated from highschool in 2011 and, after a gap year living in Chicago, IL, I came back to Portland and enrolled at Portland Community College. I didn't have a clue what I wanted to do at that point so I just took a lot of prerequisites and a few electives that sounded interesting. With college being so expensive I decided that it was irresponsible to continue with college when I have no real sense of what I wanted to do or to major in.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <p>I have worked many jobs but the last two jobs I had were in the realm of what I would like to do. The last jobs I had were both at tech start-ups. At the first of these two I worked as an Implementation Specialist for a digital marketing company. As an Implementation Specialist I would add content like copy, images, links, lists, and resorces into a content management system (or CMS for short). This would populate on the front end, displaying all of the content the client provided as a beautiful personalised website.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <p>The second of my last two jobs I worked as a Fraud Prevention Specialist for a popular vacation rental company. As a Fraud Prevention Specialist I would scan through high risk vacation reservations to try to identify whether or not the reservation was created using a stolen credit card. If I was able to conclusively identify one of these reservations I would cancel it, refund the card, and then reach out to the authorities to turn over what I have found.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <p>There were certain coding elements required by these jobs, but nothing very specialized. But, during the times I was required to code, I would really enjoy it. I had tried to use a few languages to streamline my workflow and the workflow of my team but I would always encounter obstacles and barries that I simply did not have the know-how needed to overcome. I enrolled in the <span class="epicodus-logo-color">Epicodus</span> coding bootcamp in order to obtain the knowledge necessary to solve problems, streamline workflows, and build my own projects from scratch. Once I graduate I look forward to landing a job as a programmer!</p>
